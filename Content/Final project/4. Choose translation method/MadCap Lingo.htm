        <h1>MadCap Lingo</h1>
        <p>MadCap Lingo is a translation management tool developed by MadCap Software specifically for working with Flare projects.</p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You create a Lingo project from your Flare project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lingo handles the extraction, translation, review, and reintegration of content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Supports TM, glossaries, machine translation integration, and quality assurance checks.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Tight integration with Flare: Directly understands Flare structures — topics, snippets, variables, conditions, and even microcontent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All-in-one workflow: Project management, translation, and QA are all built into Lingo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preserves structure: No risk of losing snippets, conditions, or complex linking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Facilitates in-house translation: Allows companies with internal translators to manage translation without needing third-party CAT tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translation memory and glossary support: Automatically reuse previous translations across projects.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Learning curve: Requires learning the Lingo interface and functionality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Licensing cost: Requires separate licensing from Flare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Limited LSP adoption: Not all LSPs are familiar with Lingo, so if you're outsourcing, you may need to export XLIFF instead.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Best use cases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Organizations that want full control over the translation process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Projects with a lot of reuse (variables, snippets, conditions) that would be cumbersome to manage manually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Companies with in-house technical writers who also translate or manage localization.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can create a Lingo project from your Flare project. Once your in-house translator (or external linguist) completes the translation inside Lingo, you simply synchronize the translated content back into Flare with minimal manual effort.</p>
