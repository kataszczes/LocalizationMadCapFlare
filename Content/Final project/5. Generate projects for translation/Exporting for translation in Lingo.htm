        <h1>Exporting for translation in Lingo</h1>
        <p>If your translation workflow is based inside your organization, or if your LSP uses MadCap Lingo, you can export and translate entirely within the Lingo environment — no need for separate files.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Export your Flare project (to see this procedure, go to <MadCap:xref href="Exporting Flare Project.htm">Exporting Flare Project</MadCap:xref> section).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a Lingo Project from Flare (to see this procedure, go to <MadCap:xref href="Creating Lingo Project.htm">Creating Lingo Project</MadCap:xref> section).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translate directly in Lingo or export a LIPRJZIP bundle to send to your LSP. To create a LIPRJZIP bundle:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Select View &gt; File List.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Select the files to be included in the bundle.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the local toolbar click the Create Bundle button.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the Bundle Settings area, select the Lingo Project Bundle and check the project files to include with the bundle.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Include Project Translation Memories, as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Include Project Termbases, as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click OK. Statistics for the project will appear.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click Close. A subfolder (within your project folder) named "Exporting" opens. This subfolder holds the LIPRJZIP file. This file contains the files that your translator needs to work with.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Send the LIPRJZIP file (via email, FTP, etc.) to the translator along with a style guide, if available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once translation is completed and reviewed, synchronize the translated content back into Flare.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Key considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Seamless reintegration — no need for manual imports or file conversions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Higher initial setup time but much smoother for large projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Recommended if you want full in-house control over localization.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Especially valuable when maintaining multiple language versions with frequent updates.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
