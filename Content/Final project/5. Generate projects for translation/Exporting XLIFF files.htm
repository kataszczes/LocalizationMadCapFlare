        <h1>Exporting XLIFF files</h1>
        <p>XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format) is a standard for exchanging localization data. Although Flare does not generate XLIFF files directly, you can export your Flare content to MadCap Lingo, and from there, create XLIFF files for translation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Export your Flare project (to see this procedure, go to <MadCap:xref href="Exporting Flare Project.htm">Exporting Flare Project</MadCap:xref> section).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a Lingo Project from Flare (to see this procedure, go to <MadCap:xref href="Creating Lingo Project.htm">Creating Lingo Project</MadCap:xref> section).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export an XLIFF bundle to send to your LSP:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Select View → File List.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Select the files to be included in the bundle.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the local toolbar click the Create Bundle button.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the Bundle Settings area, select the XLIFF Files Bundle and check the project files to include with the bundle.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Include Project Translation Memories, as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Include Project Termbases, as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click OK. Statistics for the project will appear.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click Close. A subfolder (within your project folder) named "Exporting" opens. This subfolder holds the ZIP file. This file contains the files that your translator needs to work with.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Deliver XLIFF files to the LSP along with a style guide, if available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once translation is completed and reviewed, import the XLIFF files back into the Lingo project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export the Lingo project into a Flare project in the target language.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Key considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>XLIFF handling is done only in MadCap Lingo, not Flare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lingo acts as the bridge between Flare and external translation tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This approach ensures that complex content (conditions, variables, snippets) is protected and preserved during translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It allows easy re-import of translations into Flare without losing structure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
