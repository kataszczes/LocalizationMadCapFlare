        <h1>Generate projects for translation</h1>
        <p>Before translation work can begin, your Flare project must be prepared and exported correctly. The method you choose will depend on the tools you and your localization partner (LSP) are using. Each export method has its own best practices, advantages, and limitations.</p>
        <p>In this chapter, we outline three key methods of exporting projects for translation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Exporting output files.htm">Exporting without MadCap Lingo</a> (using output files),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Exporting XLIFF files.htm">Exporting with MadCap Lingo</a> (using XLIFF files),</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Exporting for translation in Lingo.htm">Exporting for direct translation in MadCap Lingo</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each method supports different workflows — understanding them will help you avoid errors, delays, and extra costs during the localization process.</p>
