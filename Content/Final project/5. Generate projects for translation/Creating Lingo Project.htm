        <h1>Creating Lingo Project</h1>
        <p>You can create a new Lingo translation project using the Start New Project Wizard. This wizard lets you select from many different kinds of files (for example, MadCap Flare projects, Doc-To-Help projects, Microsoft Word documents, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe InDesign, XML files, DITA files), as well as specify one or more target languages. You can also add entire folders to a project and then select the file types you want to translate.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <div>NOTE: This procedure describes basic export configuration. For a comprehensive guide on exporting Flare Projects, visit the official MadCap Flare site: <a href="https://help.madcapsoftware.com/lingo11r3/Content/Lingo/Projects/Creating-Projects.htm" target="_blank">Creating Projects</a></div>
        <h2>How to create a New Project</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Do one of the following, depending on the part of the user interface you are using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ribbon Select File → New Project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Keyboard Shortcut Press CTRL+SHIFT+N.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Start New Project Wizard opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Name field, type an appropriate name for your project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>By default, a path to the Documents\My Translated Projects folder on your hard drive is entered in the Folder field. (Lingo creates the My Translated Projects folder when you install the program.) All subfolders and files related to the translated project will be placed in this folder as you work on the project. Continue with the next step, unless you want to have your project files placed in a different folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) In the Domain field, you can type a subject category for your project, or select one from the drop-down. If you enter your own custom category in the Domain field, it will appear in the drop-down the next time you create a new project. Domain metadata appears throughout the project, such as when you select a suggestion in the translation memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) In the Client field, you can type the name of the client you are creating a translation project for. When you enter a client name in the field, it will appear in the Client drop-down the next time you create a new project. Client metadata appears throughout the project, such as when you select a suggestion in the translation memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Source Language drop-down, select the original language that is used in the project you are translating. Make sure this language matches the source exactly. For example, you might select English (en) here, but the source files are actually in the English United States (en-us) language. Therefore, you should instead select English (United States) in this field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Target Languages grid, select the language(s) that you want to use for the translation and click right arrow to move it to the Selected Languages grid. If you need to remove a language from the Selected Languages grid, click left arrow.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) If you want to bind the Lingo project to a source control provider, select Bind to source control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) If you have selected the "Bind to Source Control" option, click Bind Project. Then in the Bind Project dialog, follow one of these sets of steps, depending on the source control application being used. When you are finished, click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add files or folders to your Lingo project locally or from source control. If you select a folder, the files within it are added.</p>
                <p>To add files to a Lingo Project</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Click Add File.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the dialog that opens, navigate to the project or files that you want to translate. You may need to click the file type drop-down to view and select the appropriate kind of files you want to add.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you need to select only one file, you can double-click it. If you need to select multiple files (for example, multiple Word documents) in the same folder, you can hold your SHIFT or CTRL key and select either a range or individual files; then click Open.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) If you are creating a project using MadCap Flare or DITA source files, select additional project settings. (flatten variables, flatten snippets, create language skin, etc.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) Available translation memory (TM) databases are listed in a grid, and you can select the ones you want to use for the current project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(Optional) Available termbases are listed in a grid, and you can select the ones you want to use for the current project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Finish.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you create a new Lingo project, a file with an .liprj extension is automatically generated (for example, My Project Polish.liprj).</p>
