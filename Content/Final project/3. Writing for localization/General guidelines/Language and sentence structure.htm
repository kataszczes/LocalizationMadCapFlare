        <h1>Language and sentence structure</h1>
        <p>Clear, simple language is the cornerstone of localization-friendly content. The way sentences are constructed — and the language used — directly affects not only how well content is understood by global audiences, but also how easily and accurately it can be translated, especially when using machine translation or translation memory systems. This section presents best practices for writing content that is linguistically neutral, easy to parse, and optimized for localization workflows.</p>
        <h3>Why simple language matters in localization</h3>
        <p>When source content is written clearly and simply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Translators can understand it faster and more accurately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Machine Translation (MT) tools produce better results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Localization costs are reduced due to fewer ambiguities or clarification needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>End users can quickly grasp the information, regardless of cultural or linguistic background.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Writing in simple language is not "dumbing down” your content — it’s about making your information clear, accessible, and translatable. It reduces misunderstandings, shortens localization timelines, and improves the user experience for global audiences.</p>
        <h3> Write in simple, global English</h3>
        <p>Use clear, straightforward vocabulary. Favor everyday terms over technical jargon or idiomatic expressions. Choose unambiguous language to reduce the risk of mistranslation or misunderstanding.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid idioms and metaphors</p>
                <p>❌ “We're ironing out the details.”</p>
                <p>✅ “We are finalizing the details.”</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid slang and region-specific phrases</p>
                <p>❌ “Give it a shot.”</p>
                <p>✅ “Try it.”</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use standard English spelling and grammar</p>
                <p>Stick to consistent spelling conventions (for example, US English or UK English), and avoid switching within a project.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Use short, direct sentences</h3>
        <p>Sentence length and structure directly impact translatability. Shorter sentences are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Easier to understand</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Easier to parse by machine translation engines</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Easier to segment into translation memory systems</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Keep sentences under 20 words when possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Break long, compound sentences into separate ideas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Eliminate unnecessary modifiers or qualifiers.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>❌ “If the option is enabled and all the system requirements are met, the user will be able to continue using the software without further interruption.”</p>
        <p>✅ “Enable the option. If system requirements are met, the software runs without interruption.”</p>
        <h3>Use the active voice</h3>
        <p>Active voice is clearer and more direct, which aids comprehension and makes it easier for translators to retain the meaning.</p>
        <p>❌ “The system should be checked by the user.”</p>
        <p>✅ “The user should check the system.”</p>
        <p>This also helps clarify who does what, reducing ambiguity — especially in procedural or instructional content.</p>
        <h3>Use consistent terminology</h3>
        <p>Use the same term to refer to the same concept throughout your documentation. Inconsistent naming increases cognitive load for readers and creates extra work for translators, who may have to verify that two different terms refer to the same thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain a project-specific glossary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Define preferred terms in your style guide.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use MadCap Flare <a href="../Prudent use of Flare features/Variables.htm">variables</a> for product names, version numbers, or other repeated terms that may change between localizations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Avoid ambiguity</h3>
        <p>Ambiguous language causes confusion in any language. When content is translated, ambiguity is amplified.</p>
        <p>❌ “Click the button when it appears.” — (What button? Appears where?)</p>
        <p>✅ “Click the Install button when it appears in the toolbar.”</p>
        <p>Be specific about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Objects (“this dialog” vs. “the confirmation dialog”)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Conditions and timing</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Use parallel sentence structures</h3>
        <p>Use consistent syntax and structure for similar content to aid readability and translation memory reuse.</p>
        <p>✅ Good:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>Click the Save icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Print icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Export icon.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>❌ Inconsistent:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>Click the Save icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To print the document, select the Print icon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export the file using the Export option.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parallel structures improve pattern recognition, especially in translation memory (TM) systems, increasing efficiency.</p>
        <h3>Prefer standard word order</h3>
        <p>Use Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) structure. This is the most common sentence format and is well-supported by MT tools.</p>
        <p>✅ “The user enters a password.”</p>
        <p>❌ “A password is required to be entered by the user.”</p>
        <h3>Consider the use of machine translation (MT) and translation memory (TM)</h3>
        <p>Simple, predictable sentence patterns benefit translation systems. Avoid creative or complex phrasings that might break matches in translation memory or reduce MT quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Write like a machine will read it first — because it will.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also avoid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Long noun chains: “user password expiration warning preferences”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pronoun ambiguity: “If it fails, restart it.” (What is “it”?)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Remember your audience</h3>
        <p>Writing for localization means writing for non-native speakers and users across cultures. Use inclusive and respectful language, and avoid assumptions about the user's technical level, background, or environment.</p>
