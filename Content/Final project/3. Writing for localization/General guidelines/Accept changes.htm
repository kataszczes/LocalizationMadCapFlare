        <h1>Accept changes</h1>
        <p>Before sending content for translation, it's critical to accept all tracked changes in your MadCap Flare project or source documents. While tracked changes are helpful during review, leaving them in place can cause serious issues in localization.</p>
        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Word count inflation: Both deleted and inserted text may be counted, increasing translation cost unnecessarily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translator confusion: It's unclear which version of the text is final, leading to delays or errors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tool compatibility: CAT tools (including MadCap Lingo) may not handle tracked changes correctly, which can cause formatting or segmentation issues.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Best practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Finalize edits before exporting: Ensure reviews are complete and content is stable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Accept or reject all changes: Use Flare’s Review pane to confirm a clean state.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Export only the finalized version: This ensures translators receive consistent, unambiguous input.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
