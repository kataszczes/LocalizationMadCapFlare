        <h1>Error mitigation</h1>
        <p>Errors in localization projects often originate in the source content. These can propagate during translation and require costly post-editing and quality assurance.</p>
        <p>Best practices to reduce errors in your writing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Check for linguistic accuracy: Typos, missing articles, or unclear phrasing may confuse both readers and translators.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Minimize text in multimedia: Avoid embedding text in images or animations, which requires re-creation in each language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Handle placeholders and variables consistently: For example, always use consistent notation for product names or UI terms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pre-validate content: Use MadCap Flare’s built-in analysis tools to detect formatting issues, broken links, or duplicate IDs before export.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
