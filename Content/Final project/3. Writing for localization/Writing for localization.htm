        <h1>Writing for localization</h1>
        <p>Creating localizable content is a critical component in building user-friendly documentation that supports global audiences. While translation handles converting content from one language to another, localization is more holistic — it adjusts content to reflect cultural nuances, regulatory norms, and formatting expectations specific to each locale. This chapter outlines strategies and practices for writing content that is localization-ready from the outset, significantly improving quality and reducing translation costs and turnaround time.</p>
        <p>A proactive content strategy also benefits downstream stages in the localization lifecycle, especially when using tools like MadCap Flare and Lingo. This chapter introduces general principles, sentence-level guidelines, terminology management, and review strategies that help technical communicators produce consistent, reusable, and translatable content.</p>
