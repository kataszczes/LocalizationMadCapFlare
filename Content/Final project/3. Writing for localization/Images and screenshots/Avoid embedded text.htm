        <h1>Avoid embedded text</h1>
        <p>Embedding text directly into images (for example, using graphic design tools to place text within screenshots) renders the text inaccessible to translation tools. This practice necessitates manual extraction and re-embedding of translated text, increasing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.</p>
        <h4>Best practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use callouts and captions: Instead of embedding text, utilize callouts or captions that are separate from the image. MadCap Capture allows for the creation of callouts that are stored in an accompanying XML-based <code>.props</code> file, facilitating easy translation without altering the image itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Leverage vector graphics: When possible, use vector graphics for illustrations. Vector formats enable the separation of text from images, allowing for straightforward text updates without modifying the graphic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain text in source files: Keep all textual content within the source files of your documentation project. This approach ensures that translation memory systems can access and process the text efficiently.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>❌ Poor practice: A screenshot with embedded English text like "Click here to start" requires creating a new image for each language.</p>
        <p>✅ Improved practice: A screenshot without text, accompanied by a caption or callout in the documentation that reads "Click the 'Start' button."</p>
