        <h1>Utilize layered files and MadCap Capture</h1>
        <p>Managing multiple versions of images for different languages can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with embedded text and annotations.</p>
        <h4>Best practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Adopt MadCap Capture: Use MadCap Capture to create layered images where text annotations are stored separately from the image in .props files. This separation simplifies the translation process and maintains consistency across languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain source files: Keep original, editable image files organized and accessible. This practice facilitates updates and modifications without recreating images from scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Integrate with translation workflows: Ensure that the text layers in images are included in the translation workflow, allowing translators to access and modify text without altering the image itself.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>❌ Poor practice: Creating separate images for each language, embedding translated text directly into each version.</p>
        <p>✅ Improved practice: Using a single image with text layers managed through MadCap Capture, enabling efficient updates and consistency across all language versions.</p>
