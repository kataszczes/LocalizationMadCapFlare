        <h1>Utilize layered files and MadCap Capture</h1>
        <p>Managing multiple versions of images for different languages can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with embedded text and annotations.</p>
        <h2>Best practices:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Adopt MadCap Capture:</span> Use MadCap Capture to create layered images where text annotations are stored separately from the image in <code>.props</code> files. This separation simplifies the translation process and maintains consistency across languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Maintain source files:</span> Keep original, editable image files organized and accessible. This practice facilitates updates and modifications without recreating images from scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bulletIntroduction">Integrate with translation workflows:</span> Ensure that the text layers in images are included in the translation workflow, allowing translators to access and modify text without altering the image itself.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="descriptiveExample">Example:
        <div class="badDescriptiveExample">❌ Poor practice: Creating separate images for each language, embedding translated text directly into each version.</div><div class="goodDescriptiveExample">✅ Improved practice: Using a single image with text layers managed through MadCap Capture, enabling efficient updates and consistency across all language versions.</div></div>
