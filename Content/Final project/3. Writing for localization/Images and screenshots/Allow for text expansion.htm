        <h1>Allow for text expansion</h1>
        <p>Translated text often occupies more space than the original language. For instance, German translations can be up to 30% longer than their English counterparts. Without accommodating this expansion, text may overlap or extend beyond designated areas in images.</p>
        <h4>Best practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Design flexible layouts: When creating callouts or annotations, ensure they can expand or contract based on text length. MadCap Capture supports auto-sizing of text boxes, which adjusts the size dynamically to fit the content .</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test with pseudo-localization: Implement pseudo-localization techniques to simulate text expansion and identify potential layout issues before actual translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid fixed-size containers: Refrain from using fixed-size text containers in images. Instead, allow for dynamic resizing to accommodate varying text lengths.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>❌ Poor practice: A fixed-size callout box that fits only the English text "End" may not accommodate the Polish translation "Zakończ," leading to text overflow.</p>
        <p>✅ Improved practice: A dynamically resizing callout box that adjusts to fit the translated text, maintaining readability and aesthetics.</p>
