        <h1>Avoid hardcoded dimensions</h1>
        <p>Hardcoding image dimensions can lead to display issues across different devices and languages. Fixed sizes may not accommodate text expansion or varying screen resolutions, resulting in distorted or truncated images.</p>
        <h4>Best practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use relative sizing: Define image sizes using relative units (for example, percentages) instead of fixed pixels. This approach ensures images scale appropriately across different devices and layouts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implement responsive design: Design images and layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, enhancing accessibility and user experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test across outputs: Preview images in different output formats (HTML5, PDF) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>❌ Poor practice: An image set to a fixed width of 600 pixels may not display correctly on smaller screens or accommodate longer translated text.</p>
        <p>✅ Improved practice: An image set to occupy 100% of the container width, allowing it to scale appropriately based on the viewing device.</p>
